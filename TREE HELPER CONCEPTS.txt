-	 Because from a given node there is more than one possible next node (it is not a linear data structure), then, assuming sequential computation (not parallel), some nodes must be deferred—stored in some way for later visiting. This is often done via a stack (LIFO) or queue (FIFO). As a tree is a self-referential (recursively defined) data structure, traversal can be defined by recursion or, more subtly, corecursion, in a very natural and clear fashion; in these cases the deferred nodes are stored implicitly in the call stack.

-	Most simply, does one go down first (depth-first search: left child, then grandchildren before right child) or across first (breadth-first search: left child, then right child before grandchildren)? Depth-first search is further classified by position of the root element with regard to the left and right nodes. Imagine that the left and right nodes are constant in space, then the root could be placed to the left of the left node (pre-order), between the left and right node (in-order), or to the right of the right node (post-order). There is no equivalent variation in breadth-first search—given an ordering of children, "breadth-first" is unambiguous.
